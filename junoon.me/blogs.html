		<p>Cleaners are employed across professional sectors. Be it industrial, corporates, or residential buildings, they tend to prove to be a vital cog in the overall functioning. It would not be an exaggeration to say that their absence or inefficiency can impact how people operate or carry on with their daily lives.</p>
<p>People are always on the lookout for efficient cleaning professionals. As a cleaning professional, besides maintaining hygiene, you are to know about dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning ceiling vents, restroom cleaning, etc. Now, if you happen to be a cleaning professional or looking to explore the job opportunity, knowing the challenges can prepare you to deal with job responsibility with ease.</p>

<p>So, what are the various challenges faced by cleaners?</p>
<p>Here is your answer.</p>
<h2>Challenges faced by a cleaner</h2>
<p>Skill development for cleaners is aimed at elevating the standards of cleaning professionals. You can easily execute every instruction when you are aware of all the little aspects of your job. It is highly recommended to go for <a href="auto-mechanic-checklist-best-practices/attachment/cleaning.html"><strong>cleaning training courses</strong></a> to know about various challenges mentioned below, and how to deal with them efficiently.</p>
<h3>Unavailability of the right equipment</h3>
<p>People expect cleaners to do every bit of cleaning without any complaining. However, if asked about the right equipment for a cleaning professional not many can go beyond brooms, vacuum cleaners, or clothes. Unavailability of the right equipment becomes especially troublesome in professional surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: It is advisable to find out the availability of the right equipment at the very beginning of starting out your job. Ask for the various equipment you will be provided once you start working and, if you find anything missing, make sure you ask your employers about the same.</p>
<h3>Exposure to harmful substances</h3>
<p>Professional surrounding such as one in a chemical factory tends to be harmful to everyone. But, for cleaners, it is an occupational hazard wherein they might not be involved with much of the functioning but must make sure that the factory is up and running for the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Safety gear! It is mandated by government rules to provide necessary safety gear such as boots, jackets, helmets, masks, etc. Do not hesitate to ask for the right safety clothes or accessories necessary for you to carry out different tasks without any trouble.</p>
<h3>Lack of communication skills</h3>
<p>Often, we have seen cleaners getting into the unnecessary discussion, arguments with people for no fault of theirs. Much of it can be attributed to the lack of proper communication skills. It is not only for cleaners rather every blue-collar worker takes time to adjust to the new environment.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Cleaning training courses are designed to help individuals get trained in every aspect of their job. Communication is an important aspect of the overall training module. It helps you to understand the professional tone and how to get across your message without any conflict.</p>
<h3>Health hazards</h3>
<p>The main objective of any cleaner is to maintain optimum hygiene. Now, what are you supposed to do if you are allergic to dust? These are occupational hazard which you have to deal with smartly. Depending upon the task at hand, there are various health hazards which poses risk for the cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Be mindful of your surroundings. If you are allergic to dust or any other substance, make sure you communicate it to your employer and get the necessary equipment to carry on with your job.</p>
<p>The above mentioned are the prominent challenges faced by cleaners.

		<p>There is no denying that every country is dependent upon its blue collar workers to function. Every day we pass by these people without even acknowledging their contribution to an extent that we remain ignorant of their needs. COVID19 probably highlighted their role when people serving as security guards, maids, or anything else had to leave for their hometowns, and people were left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>The fact about blue collar workers is that not only do they make our lives easy but also ensure that many untoward hassles are kept at a bay, so that, we can go about our daily routines without any hassle.</p>
<h2>What are various blue collar jobs?</h2>
<p>A profession wherein the employee has to perform manual labor is deemed as a blue collar job. There are approximately 450 million people in India who are listed under the blue collar work category.</p>
<p><strong>Blue collar jobs include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Security guards</li>
<li>Carpenters</li>
<li>Electricians</li>
<li>Plumbers</li>
<li>Auto-mechanics</li>
<li>Drivers</li>
<li>Gardeners</li>
<li>Runners</li>
<li>Painters</li>
<li>Construction workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Their contribution to nation-building and in our lives, cannot be emphasized much. All you have to do is imagine a day wherein there is no security guard at your building gate, no plumber to repair faulty faucets or inefficient construction workers.</p>
<p>There are times when we do not actually pay much heed to their requirements and their standards of life. Though blue collar workers job demand never goes out of trend our perception towards them must change.</p>
<p>It is time to bust myths about blue collar workers and reveal the real facts about them.</p>
<h2>What are myths and facts about blue collared workers?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1365" src="wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Myths-and-Facts-about-Blue-Collared-Workers.jpg" alt="Myths and Facts about Blue Collared Workers" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://junoon.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Myths-and-Facts-about-Blue-Collared-Workers.jpg 800w, https://junoon.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Myths-and-Facts-about-Blue-Collared-Workers-300x150.jpg 300w, https://junoon.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Myths-and-Facts-about-Blue-Collared-Workers-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: They do not do much work</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: They do more than anyone can imagine</p>
<p>Eh! What does a security guard do? Sit all day in the cabin, open the gates, and at night they are sleeping throughout! This is the common statement that is thrown without much thought and consideration. What we need to understand is that though the job role might not be as fancy as a software engineer or a marketing guru, their work is filled with plenty of challenges. The prominent being pacifying rowdy attendees for no fault of theirs.</p>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: They charge for more than they deserve</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: They deserve every penny they ask for</p>
<p>It is common to negotiate for a lesser price with the construction workers. We tend to overlook the intricate process of building a wall. What escapes our eyes is the manual labor and the perfection with which everything must be executed at a construction site. Also, with broker commission, they tend to lose out on their full salaries. Next time try to be considerate when negotiating for their wages.</p>
<p><strong>Myth</strong>: They often indulge in theft</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: All they want to do is get the job done</p>
<p>This can probably be attributed to movies but, people tend to suspect their housemaids or security guards for anything untoward that happens. It is better to adopt a calm approach rather than simply asking people if they stole something. This hugely impacts their self-respect and confidence. Trust is important for any relation even in professional.</p>
<p>The thing is, they are working for you, you are not doing them a favor, but it is they who make sure that you can enjoy your life. So, the least you can do is get rid of preconceived notions and be respectful of their needs and pay what they deserve.</p>
<p>However, the trend seems to be changing as people are taking blue collar workers’ duties seriously and make sure that none of them are treated badly and they get their dues.</p>
<h2>How can we help for blue collar workers?</h2>
<p>COVID19 has greatly impacted the job opportunities for blue collar workers. They are yet to understand the use of smartphones wherein there are ample job postings for blue collar workers. If you happen to know any such workers you can inform them about the job or even better, help them understand the whole process of applying for jobs and how they can get better. Online portal like Junoon not only offers better training to blue collar workers, but also assists them to find suitable placement under one roof.</p>
